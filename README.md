# Ergast API Automation

This repository contains automated tests for The Ergast Developer API, which provides a historical record of motor racing data. The tests are built using the Rest Assured library and BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) frameworks such as Cucumber to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the API's data.

## Features

- **Rest Assured**: A powerful Java DSL for simplifying testing of REST services.
- **BDD Framework**: Implements BDD using Cucumber to define test scenarios in a human-readable format.
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Covers various endpoints and scenarios to validate the data provided by the Ergast API.

## Project Structure

- `src/test/java`: Contains the Java test scripts.
- `src/test/resources`: Contains Cucumber feature files written in Gherkin syntax.
- `pom.xml`: Maven configuration file for managing dependencies.
